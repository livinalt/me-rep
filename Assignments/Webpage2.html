    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h2>Hi, I'm Marcia!</h2>
    <P>Welcome to my studio in the woods! Here I work with many ideas and little Wi-Fi. I am an illustrator, designer, mom and wife. A city girl who moved to the country. Since I was little I knew I wanted to dedicate myself to something creative. I found my ideal profession in design, as it allows me to combine it with my other passion, which is illustration. </P>
    <p>I am lucky to work from home, while enjoying my family. I am inspired by the beauty that surrounds me and the fairy tales that I write in my mind since I was a child. My work reflects my childhood of cartoons and my daughter's exploring nature. My favorite techniques are watercolors, colored pencils, and of course digital art on the iPad.</p>

    <h2>My Partners</h2>
    <p>I've worked with many organizations in the past on various projects. My current partners include Zyro, Pantone, SkillShare and Domestika. </p>

    <h2>My Daily Life</h2>
    <p>I fell in love and my prince invited me to live in the forest where he grew up. I always dreamed of one day becoming a mother. Seeing my children grow up in the countryside and dedicating myself to what I love to do the most. Today I dedicate myself to LIVING all my dreams, living in nature, living motherhood and living from my art.</p>
