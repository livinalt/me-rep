<p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising
     pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the 
     actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.
      No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because 
      those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are
       extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain 
       pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in 
       which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.</p>
